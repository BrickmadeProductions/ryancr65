- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan Crowder!
  - I own a small indie development company - Brickmade Productions
  - I currently have 2 Games:
     Welcome To The Backrooms https://store.steampowered.com/app/2007010/Welcome_To_The_Backrooms/
     Arcane Arena (Currently In Development)
    
  - And I am currently working on an in house engine written entirely in C++.
  
About me:
I am a hardworking motivated individual who loves to make video games. I have a small community of people who are also passionate about making / playing games on our company discord: https://discord.gg/p3QczNN9mR
I love learning new information about all sorts of things including: coding, game design, art, and AI! Just to name a few....

If you would like to view the code for Mortar Engine and Arcane Arena, contact me via email at: brickmadeproductions5@gmail.com
I currently do not have them public as I plan on continuing their development.
